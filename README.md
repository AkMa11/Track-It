# Track-It
This is an Android application for tracking buses using GPS system.
This is a standalone solution for private or government bus services.
Administrator is able to add, update, remove drivers and buses from the database and assign buses to the drivers.
Drivers are able to see the buses assigned to them and turn on the GPS broadcast.
Users will be able to search bus numbers to track the appropriate buses on a map user interface.
This is a very simple yet effective solution for GPS tracking.
I have created this as my final year MCA project.
